# Cucumber Step Definitions Directory

This directory contains the step definitions for our Cucumber test suites. Step definitions are the Java methods that link the plain text Gherkin steps to code implementations. Each method is annotated with a Cucumber expression that matches a specific step in the feature files.

## Directory Overview

The `step_definitions` directory is structured to mirror the organization of the feature files in the `features` directory. Each set of step definitions is responsible for handling the steps of one or more feature files, typically grouped by functionality or domain area.

## Writing Step Definitions

When writing step definitions, please adhere to the following best practices:

- Keep step definitions concise and focused on the action or assertion they are intended to perform.
- Avoid including complex logic in step definitions; delegate to tasks and questions methods.
- Use expressive and parameterized Cucumber expressions to maximize step re-usability.
- Maintain clear separation between step definitions for different features or domains.
