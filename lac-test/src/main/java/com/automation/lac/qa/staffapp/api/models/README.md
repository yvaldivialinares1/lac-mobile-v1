# Java Serialization Models

This directory is dedicated to housing the model classes that are used for serialization and deserialization processes within our Java application. These models are crucial for ensuring that data can be correctly converted to and from formats such as JSON, XML, or other data interchange formats.

## Directory Structure

Each model class is defined in its own `.java` file within this directory. The models are organized based on the domain or the specific use case they are related to.
