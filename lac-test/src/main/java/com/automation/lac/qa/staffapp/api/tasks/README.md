# API Tasks Directory

This directory contains the API task classes for our Java project. Each class within this directory corresponds to a specific API and contains static methods to perform various operations related to that API.

## Structure

The API tasks are organized within this directory such that each API has a dedicated class. The class name should reflect the API it interacts with, and the methods within should encapsulate the API operations as static methods.

## Class and Method Structure

- Class names should be descriptive and reflect the API or resource they are working with.
- Methods should be static and named to clearly indicate the action they perform.
- Each method should handle the construction of API requests, sending the requests, and processing the responses.
- Use helper methods to avoid code duplication and to promote code reusability.
