# Cucumber Hooks Directory

This directory is home to the Cucumber Hooks specific to our TestNG-powered automation framework. Hooks are blocks of code that can run at various points in the Cucumber execution cycle, such as before and after each scenario, or even before and after each step.

## Purpose of Hooks

Hooks offer a place to put setup and teardown operations that need to occur around every test scenario. Common uses include:

- Preparing test data
- Configuring API or database connections
- Cleaning up after tests
- Taking screenshots or gathering additional information for reporting purposes

## Directory Structure

The hooks within this directory are organized into classes that reflect the type of setup or teardown operations they represent. Each class may contain multiple methods annotated with Cucumber's hook annotations.

## Writing Hooks

When writing hooks, follow these guidelines:

- Use descriptive names for hook methods to clearly indicate their purpose.
- Keep hook methods concise and focused on a single type of setup or teardown operation.
- Avoid overloading hooks with logic that could be better placed within step definitions or helper methods.
